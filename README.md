# Camera Barndoor Tracking Mount

Desktop barndoor mount for astrophotography with phd2/ascom autoguiding interface.

This started out as a basic barndoor mount with a hinge mounted on a tripod like many others.  However the cheap tripod I had wobbled too much and I decided to convert it into a tabletop mount.  I added an adjustable altitude axis for easy setup, then thought why not add an ascom interface so that it can be used with phd2 autoguiding for greater accuracy.  Now it a bit odd for a mount to be half alt/az and half equatorial axis (in this case Altitude and Right Ascention), but this seems to work fine for the phd2 guiding.  If polar aligned properly the altitude axis is almost redundant anyway.
